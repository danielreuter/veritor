Use modern Python typing -- e.g. dict, list instead of Dict, List

Use pytest, and put all tests in /tests. Don't write test scripts at the root directory unless you intend to delete them shortly afterwards (and make sure you do so, keep a clean workspace). Any more permanent test should be written in /tests.

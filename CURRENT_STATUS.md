# Veritor Implementation Status

## ✅ Current State (All 65 Tests Passing)

### What's Working

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - WorkloadDatabase for storing graphs, traces, and data
   - IR blob storage with content-addressable hashing
   - StableHLO graph manipulation and transformation
   - Challenge generation and verification systems

2. **Inference Verification**
   - Simple deterministic inference verification
   - Autoregressive inference with teacher-forcing verification
   - Distributed inference simulation
   - Three-party inference protocols
   - Dynamic hook injection using JAX pure_callback

3. **Training Verification**
   - Simple training with gradient verification
   - Checkpoint storage and retrieval
   - LSH-based gradient challenges

4. **Sampling & Determinism**
   - Deterministic sampling implementations
   - Temperature, top-k, top-p sampling strategies
   - Statistical verification of sampling behavior

5. **Graph Transformations**
   - Basic AR to TF transformation (simplified version works)
   - Function extraction and manipulation
   - Support for newer JAX features (sdy dialect handling)

### Test Coverage

- **65 tests** covering all major components
- Tests include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end workflows
- Stress testing for sampling and transformation brittleness

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Graph Surgery for AR→TF**
   - Full IREE Transform dialect implementation doesn't detect JAX-outlined functions
   - JAX outlines while loop bodies into separate functions (`func.call`)
   - Simplified version works but doesn't do full transformation
   - Real solution needs to follow function calls to find AR patterns

2. **Device Management**
   - No real Device API yet (Step 8 in plan)
   - All "distributed" tests run on CPU with simulation

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Need real GPU testing (Step 6-7 in plan)
   - Non-determinism handling needs refinement
   - Memory spot-check protocol not implemented (Step 8-9)

## 📊 Progress Against SPEC.md Plan

✅ **Step 0: De-risking**
- AR→TF transformation proven feasible (with limitations)
- Sampling canonicalization implemented

✅ **Step 1: Single device**
- Simple inference/training working
- LSH challenges implemented
- Database abstractions working
- Nice test harness established

✅ **Step 2: Mock distribution**
- Logical↔distributed graph handling
- Simulated multi-device execution

✅ **Step 3: Checkpointing**
- Random model checkpointing works

✅ **Step 4: Autoregressive**
- AR workloads supported
- Teacher-forcing verification implemented

✅ **Step 5: Sampling**
- RNG and sampling canonicalized
- Multiple sampling strategies tested

⏳ **Step 6-7: Cloud GPUs**
- Not yet tested on real GPUs
- LLM scale testing pending

⏳ **Step 8-9: Device API & Memory Spot Checks**
- Device registry not implemented
- Memory spot-check protocol not built
- Ray Data integration pending

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Make it solid)
1. ✅ Fix test failures (DONE)
2. ✅ Ensure all tests pass consistently (DONE)
3. Document API usage examples
4. Add more comprehensive integration tests

### Short-term
1. Test on real GPUs (Colab/Cloud)
2. Handle non-determinism properly
3. Implement proper Device registry
4. Add real LLM inference examples

### Medium-term
1. Fix AR→TF transformation to handle outlined functions
2. Implement memory spot-check protocol
3. Build Ray Data integration for dataflow graphs
4. Write verification papers (training & inference)

## 🔑 Key Achievements

1. **Unified Abstractions Work**: The Graph/Trace/Data model successfully captures workloads
2. **Verification is Feasible**: Can verify inference, training, and sampling
3. **Hooks are Dynamic**: JAX pure_callback enables truly external challenges
4. **Database is Functional**: Content-addressable storage with proper provenance
5. **Tests are Comprehensive**: 65 tests provide good coverage and confidence

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **JAX Optimizations Matter**: JAX outlines functions, affecting graph analysis
2. **MLIR/IREE APIs are Complex**: Need careful handling of dialects and passes
3. **Dtype Precision Matters**: float32 vs float64 causes verification issues
4. **Separation Works**: Clean prover/verifier separation is achievable
5. **Incremental Progress is Key**: Step-by-step implementation plan is working

The system is functional and demonstrates the core STAMP protocol concepts. While not production-ready for large-scale deployment, it successfully proves the verification approach and provides a solid foundation for further development.
